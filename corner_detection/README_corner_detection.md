Understanding HSV Ranges in OpenCV vs. Online Resources

When working with HSV color values, it's essential to recognize that the range 
of values in OpenCV differs from those in many online color pickers or other 
color manipulation tools.

----- HSV Ranges in OpenCV -----
Hue: 0 to 180
Saturation: 0 to 255
Value (Brightness): 0 to 255

----- HSV Ranges in Online Color Pickers -----
Hue: 0 to 360
Saturation: 0 to 100%
Value (Brightness): 0 to 100%
