# Algorithm

## Description
This code tests and runs the Ram Ram algorithm by controlling the movements of two robots through a Tkinter window. 

## Mode
We have 2 mode inside ram.py
1. TEST_MODE: When it
2. BATTLE_MODE:

## Packages
In order to get the Algorithm code to work, you need install the following libraries

- Pygame : `pip install Pygame`
- Tkinter : `pip install Tk`
- Pyserial : `python -m pip install pyserial`

## Running the Algorithm

You should be able to run the code in either the Autonomous-24-25 folder or the Algorithm folder

IF Algorithm Folder:
Run `python3 pygame_test.py`

IF Autonomous-24-25:
Run `python3 Algorithm/pygame_test.py`

## Testing

C
